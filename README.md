# GeoPulse Intelligence

**Geopolitical-finance intelligence for everyone.** GeoPulse connects world events to market movements in real time — helping you understand what's happening, why it matters, and which assets are affected.

Built for analysts, investors, and curious minds who want Bloomberg-level insight without the Bloomberg price tag. Entirely self-hosted. Zero API costs.

## The Problem

Geopolitical events move markets every day. When OPEC cuts oil output, energy stocks surge. When trade tensions escalate, semiconductor ETFs drop. But connecting the dots between world events and market impact requires expensive terminals, fragmented news sources, and domain expertise.

**GeoPulse solves this.** It automatically ingests news from 20 countries, identifies which financial instruments are affected, measures sentiment, and learns patterns over time — all presented through an intuitive intelligence dashboard.

---

## How It Works

GeoPulse runs a continuous intelligence pipeline:

```
News Sources (50+ feeds, 20 countries)
        |
        v
   Ingestion Engine ──> Deduplicate by URL ──> Store events
        |
        v
   Correlation Engine ──> Match against 174 keyword-symbol mappings
        |                  using word-boundary regex (no false positives)
        |
        v
   Pattern Learner ──> Aggregate historical correlations
        |               Calculate confidence scores
        |
        v
   Sentiment Analyzer ──> VADER scoring (-1.0 to +1.0)
        |                  Positive / Negative / Neutral
        |
        v
   Dashboard ──> Real-time UI with TradingView charts
                 Per-country world map
                 Personalized "For You" feed
```

**Example:** An article about OPEC production cuts triggers the correlation engine. It matches the keyword `oil` (with word-boundary regex, so "turmoil" is ignored), maps it to USO, XLE, XOM, CVX, fetches live prices from Google Finance, and creates a correlation with direction and magnitude. Over time, the pattern learner recognizes that "Energy" events historically move USO up ~2.3% with 94% confidence across 47 occurrences.

## Features

**Intelligence Dashboard** — 16 filterable categories (Conflict, Energy, Economic, Technology, Trade, Healthcare, Climate, Defense, Cybersecurity, Nuclear, Agriculture, Shipping, Elections, Sanctions, Science, General). Severity-scored events with sentiment badges. Personalized "For You" feed based on your interests.

**Correlation Engine** — 174 keyword-to-symbol mappings across 17 categories. Word-boundary regex matching prevents false positives (e.g., "turmoil" does not match "oil"). Bidirectional navigation lets you go from an event to its affected stocks, or from a stock to all related news.

**Interactive World Map** — Per-country markers sized by event count and colored by severity. Click any country to see its events and which stocks they affect. Covers 40+ countries with coordinate mapping.

**Pattern Learning** — The system learns from historical correlations. Each pattern tracks average impact, direction, confidence, and occurrence count. Confidence is calculated as `min(1.0, occurrences/20 * directionConsistency)` — requiring both data volume and directional agreement. New events receive predictions based on these learned patterns.

**TradingView Charts** — Professional candlestick charts on stock detail pages and mini charts on event pages. Embedded TradingView widgets with real-time data at no cost.

**Sentiment Analysis** — VADER (Valence Aware Dictionary and sEntiment Reasoner) runs locally with no API key or cloud dependency. Scores each event from -1.0 to +1.0 and classifies as positive, negative, or neutral. Processes up to 200 events per ingestion cycle.

**Onboarding** — Three-step interest picker inspired by Perplexity. Choose your topics, regions, and stocks. The dashboard then prioritizes events matching your preferences.

**Daily Digest** — Auto-generated summary with top stories, most-mentioned stocks, market movers, category breakdowns, and sentiment distribution.
